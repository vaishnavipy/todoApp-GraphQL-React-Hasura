# Todo App app built with GraphQL + React

To build our full-stack app, I've used the below technologies.

-**React**:  Front-end framework, with component based architecture
-**GraphQL**: For data fetching and management
-**Hasura**: Set up an auto-generated GraphQL API on top of a Postgres database.
-**Heroku**: To host our database.
-**Apollo Client** : Client for our GrapQL API , which ,makes fetching data easier with its hooks.

# Technology  used:
- React Hooks(UseState, UseEffect)
- UseQuery : to query the GraphQL API
- UseMutation Hool : To add,update or delete data from the database
- GraphQL query parser
- ApolloClient for fetching data from the GraphQL server
- GraphiQL IDE for buiding the queries
- Heroku : Setup todo table and required columns for our database
